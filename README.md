**MOS** is currently in development.</br>
The reading of this [PDF](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) is strongly recommended.
# What is MOS ?
MOS is the acronyme for **Minimalist Operating System**.</br>
You can find all the **MOS** sources in this **repository**.</br>
**MOS** is targeted to [8086 family intel processors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086).</br>
# Advantages and Disadvantages
**MOS**'s meaning is to be fully customizable, from the bootloader to the kernel.</br>
You can modify **MOS** from itself or from the sources.</br>
For the moment, **MOS** is designed for the developer, don't download this OS for your grandma.</br>
# Tools
To edit files and disks, i really like to use [DD](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)), it's powerfull.</br>
If you're under Windows, you can use [HxD editor](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/), it's as powerfull as **DD**.</br>
I used [nasm](http://www.nasm.us/) to produce binary code, all the asm part of this OS are written in **nasm** syntax.
