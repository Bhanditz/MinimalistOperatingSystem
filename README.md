# MOS Operating System
MOS (**Minimalist Operating System**) is a minimalist operating system.</br>
You can find all the **MOS** sources in this **repository**.</br>
You can **modify** it or **build** it as long as you provide this [Github repository](https://github.com/leosncz/OperatingSystem).</br>
I used the **nasm** compiler to build all the **.ASMs** file.
